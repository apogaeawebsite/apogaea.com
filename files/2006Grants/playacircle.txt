brief_descrip: The piece is a star tetrahedron built of nine foot long
               copper pipes, seven 9 inch equilateral triangular
               magnetic steel corners, aluminet shade cloth skin, six
               meditation pillows inside, and thee 18 inch tall and
               wide mirrored spinning star tetrahedrons inside. It
               comes to eight feet in height, width, and depth 
                
               The central control pod structure is based on the
               geometric star tetrahedron; an eight pointed space made
               of copper pipe with three sided magnetic steel tips. 
               Half of this piece has already been created, a three
               sided pyramid 8 feet tall.  Now the downward pointing
               pyramid must be built.  Inside the upper most point of
               the tetrahedron will hang another spinning mirrored star
               tetrahedron encrusted with Tibetan quartz crystals and
               Tesla coils inside.  On the floor inside the control pod
               there will be a circle of six meditation cushions.   The
               top of the control pod tetrahedron is covered in
               aluminet.  The entire piece will be lit and powered by a
               solar array.  
                
               Using the theories of alchemy, quantum physics and
               sacred geometry I have been developing machines that
               function as galactic transmitters.  These machines
               function as a kind of worm hole generators that, when
               used with the proper intent and focus can possibly
               propel the user through space and time.  Through the use
               of ideas in transverse paraphysics it is possible to
               bend the unified field and alter space without going
               anywhere yet shifting the whole of reality. 

purpose: Playa Circle II is intended as a group meditation or
         contemplation space used for amplifying and focusing human
         subtle energy for the purpose of interdementional and etheric
         travel.  Participants who enter this intentionally energized
         circle will be encouraged to sit inside the central control
         pod and through their own subtle energy and intent may be able
         to activate the central Mer-Ka-Ba.  I consider this piece to
         be an exploration in future technology where thought becomes
         instant reality and human focused intent is the creative force
         behind it.  Following the information I received in making
         Playa Circle in 05 at Burning Man we intend to use the
         opportunity as an exploration in the future of
         interdementional travel.  it should be placed in a quiet place
         for meditation

lnt: It's plop art. set it on the ground and then remove it. E Z

safety: There is very little that can go wrong.  no fire,  low tech. 
        Screw sets are allan head, shatter proof mirror stars, the
        piece is staked down, one must bend over to enter the space
        slowing viewers down. And we will be doing a lot of education
        about the theories of the work, day and night.

rating: G

schedule: Lori Linzmier and I will be setting up Thursday afternoon and
          Friday morning. 
           
          Setup requires transporting copper pipe steel magnetic
          corners Mer-Ka-Ba pieces and fabric to the sight and
          assembling and lots of sacred intent.

           But the meditation pilows and solar power are very
           important.  the pillows are the drivers seats and
           independant solar power are the rockets.
