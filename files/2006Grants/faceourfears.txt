brief_descrip: Our project, “Facing Our Fears”, is a large-scale, interactive sculpture; a small mountain covered with sculpted faces and life-masks of actual burners to be used as hand and foot holds for climbing. 

Our team would like to build a smaller version of the
               interactive sculpture we are bringing to Burning Man
               this year. We'd like to create a section aproximately 8'
               tall by 12' wide - about a third of the final octogonal
               shape with sloping walls of faces to climb toward a
               small stage area - about four feet deep from the front.
               We will also set up a station for participants to have
               their faces cast for the final sculpture. 

purpose: This sculpture is meant to be enjoyed during the day by all
         participants. We won't have a theme camp but will be hosting
         "Get Plastered" parties at Apo to "harvest" faces for the
         final project. Ideally, we would like to have this smaller
         version built onto the back of an existing structure (such as
         a stage) but we could build it to be free-standing if
         necessary. 

lnt: We'll be renting a U-haul and will be removing all materials.
     Nothing will be burned. We're all experienced burners and
     committed to the LNT ethos. 
**the faces will be made from hydrostone (from the artist: Hydro-stone is a concrete composite - it doesn't break
and crumble like regular concrete or plaster - it has
some sort of resin as one of its components. If I find
any problems with this material for casting these
faces, I'll be immediately moving up to a more plastic
composite)

safety: There are no fire elements or projectiles on this project. The
        only danger present is of falling. Because we are using a
        scaled down version and only utilizing 8' panels at about a 45
        degree angle, any falls should be minor. 

rating: G

schedule: We would need two days prior to the event to set up and test
          the project.

textarea2: We're asking for $400 - This should fund the extras needed
           to bring this to Apo, transportation, and also to rush this
           part of the procedure to have it ready for that event.
