brief_descrip: The Snuggleupabus is a VW camper bus, 14'x4'x13',
               converted into a giant wooly mammoth.  It will require a
               5,000 Watt generator which will be mounted to the
               ass-end of the beast. 
               The Snuggleupabus will be covered with a removable
               costume which will be puppeteered by participants.

purpose: The Snuggleupabus is an interactive mutant vehicle complete
         with a Center Camp-type coffee bar and post office (the Apo
         P.O.).  If you can find the Snuggleupabus, it will be happy to
         deliver your mail within the Happy Ass Ranch.   
          
         The Snuggleupabus will be available for all participants to
         enjoy, it will be mobile and run day and night.   
          
         The Snuggleupabus would like to take the Children of Apogaea
         on scenic tours of the event on Friday and Saturday afternoons
         at 3:00 PM sharp.  The Snuggleupabus would be happy to provide
         transportation for the handicapped or otherwise challenged.  
          
         Coffee and chai will be served with all proceeds going to
         cancer research through the Relay For Life of Littleton
         Benefit for the American Cancer Society.

lnt: All cups provided will be made of burnable paper, and a receptical
     will be available.  Patrons will be encouraged to use their own
     drinking vessels to cut down on any waste that we will haul out
     from the event. 
      
     Another trash can will be available for the non-burnable lids.  I
     will be recycling the milk containers personally. 
      
     Patrons will be provided with decorating supplies to mark their
     cups making them identifiable.

safety: The Snuggleupabus will be equipped with two fire extinguishers
        and a first-aid kit.  I am certified in first-aid and CPR and
        will administer it as needed. 
         
        The Snuggleupabus has no pointy objects, projectiles, or
        combustibles.  The generator will be contained within a housing
        to prevent injury or a possible fire hazard and will also
        muffle the sound. 
         
        All volunteer participants will be covered under Sophie's Place
        (my personal business) workman's comp insurance. 
         
        The Snuggleupabus will be my personal camp, therefor I will
        personally ensure the safety of anyone in its proximity.  If I
        need to pee, I will make an executive decision as to who will
        be responsible.

rating: G

schedule: I plan to set up my project Friday morning before
          participants arrive.  I will fill out the waiver and would
          like Bug to be listed as my assistant.

textarea2: I would love to have as much support as you can provide. 
           This is a really ambitious undertaking and honestly I need
           all the help I can get.  I have been fortunate enough to get
           the espresso machine, coffee, and chai donated through Vail
           Mountain Roasters and All Brew And Chill.  $500.00 would be
           ideal to see the project through. Think of it this way, once
           it's done the years to come will be covered except for
           insurance, generator rental, and consumables.  I really want
           to see the Colorado Burning Man Community start giving back
           to the greater community. Please consider this when making
           your decision.
